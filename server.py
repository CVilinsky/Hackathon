Explanations:
Create a UDP socket that will wait for connections and send invitations.
Create a TCP socket that will get 2 connections from clients who were invited through the UDP socket.
The TCP socket will wait for 2 connections, each connection is saved into a list that will have two tuples one for each client.
We will communicate with the clients through the address recieved from them which is saved in [0] of the tuple.

The game begins once the question is sent to both of the participants.  
We will wait for both clients to respond, the one who responded first will either win or lose depending on their answer.
The winner will be saved inside a dictionary that represents the leaderboard.

In the end we will send the invitations again.
